Word "type" should not be highlighted in the following code block:
    print("A is of type %, value %.\n", type_of(a_variable), a_variable);
                   ^^^^

Detect string literals (even if we don't want to highlight them), and disable highlighting of types etc inside string literals.

Highlight % inside string literals.

Allow */ and /* inside multiline comments.
