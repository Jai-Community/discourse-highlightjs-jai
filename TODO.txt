Detect string literals (even if we don't want to highlight them), and disable highlighting of types etc inside string literals.

Highlight % inside string literals.

Allow */ and /* inside multiline comments.

Highlight "it" and "it_index" in loops. This is a very tricky one, as we only want to highlight it within the right context, whereas the word "it" can usually be found in other places, like comments.
